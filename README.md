Jupyter notebook and final writeup for Charlie Schofield and Lev Gruber's Theoretical Mechanics final project. See abstract: 

We create a non-linear correction term to Hooke's Law for polymeric materials. We proceed to simulate a simplified biological system by putting these massless, non-linear springs in series, between these springs we include masses that represent joints. Finally, we evaluate non-analytically solvable equations of motion to see how chaotic behavior arises as we vary spring constants, masses, and initial conditions.
